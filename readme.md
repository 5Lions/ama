I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means _anything_ - Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

I'm an independent fullstack developer primarily writing JavaScript. I teach, speak and write all things code. 

I'm [@WesBos](http://WesBos.com) on twitter, I blog at [wesbos.com](http://wesbos.com). 

I'm the author of the [Sublime Text Power User](http://SublimeTextBook.com) which has sold over 3,000 copies and I've produced the free video series [commandlinepoweruser.com](http://commandlinepoweruser.com/)
